# War Thunder Data Visualizer

**Short Story:**
	I wanted to visualize my personal results in the game to identify patterns.

**Long Story:**
	I have always been interested in data visualization because it allows you to clearly see obscured and unseen things, much like an oscilloscope allows you to "see" electrical signals. Art is the other reason I like it (i.e. Charles Joseph Minard, et al.) The game is very ungenerous in compensation for time spent, so I used my interests to see if there was a pattern I could exploit that would shift the returns more in my favor. I mainly did this because the relationship is very skewed against the player, in my opinion.
